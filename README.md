<h1>üìçRoadMap </h1>

What We've Done:
1. Custom songs are now put into the queue dynamically instead of being played instantly
2. The bot is able to be used across several voice channels while still keeping a consistent internal state
3. The bot has both instant and delayed replay of songs
4. The bot can have songs inserted at any point in the queue
5. The bot can have songs in the queue moved around to any arbitrary order even while running
6. Songs can be removed from the queue
7. More dynamic recommendation features: Recommendations will be made now from an arbitrary number of songs already present in the queue, and are based on particular artists and genres rather than simply "liked" and "disliked" songs

What We've Yet To Do:
1. Allow for seemless transitions between songs by automatically detecting when a song is about to finish, the pre-loading the next song in the queue.
2. Have the database of song recommendations update automatically for when new songs come out
3. Improved sound quality of the audio playback to be fully integrated into Discord's built in volume adjuster (currently peaks the audio in some extreme cases)
