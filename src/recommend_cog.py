recommend_cog.py

This module contains the RecommendCog class, a Discord bot cog for handling song recommendations
and polling based on user preferences. The cog includes two main commands:
- /poll: Allows users to select songs by reacting to a list of randomly chosen tracks from different genres.
- /recommend: Provides personalized song recommendations based on the user‚Äôs previous selections.

Classes:
    RecommendCog(commands.Cog): A cog that encapsulates song recommendation and polling commands.

Functions:
    - poll(ctx): Presents a list of 10 songs to the user, allowing them to choose up to 3 for recommendations.
    - recommend(ctx): Provides song recommendations based on selected songs, with options to save or request new suggestions.
    - generate_recommendations(selected_songs): Generates up to 10 song recommendations based on the genres of selected songs.

Dependencies:
    - discord.py: For creating and managing bot commands and message interactions.
    - asyncio: For handling asynchronous events like reactions.
    - pandas: For managing song data in DataFrames.
    - BotState: A module to maintain the current state of selected songs across bot sessions.
    - utils: Helper functions, including random_25 for selecting random recommendations.

Usage:
    Add this cog to your Discord bot instance to provide music recommendation features.
    Example:
        bot.add_cog(RecommendCog(bot))

Notes:
    This module assumes the presence of a "Song" class, which encapsulates track metadata (track name, artist, genre),
    and the "get_all_songs" and "get_songs_by_genre" functions to fetch songs.
